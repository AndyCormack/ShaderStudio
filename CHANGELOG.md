# Changelog — shader-studio

Notable changes, newest first. What/when only — the *why* lives in the [design log](docs/design/log.md) and [ADRs](docs/adr/).

## 2026-07-20

### Added
- Uniform panel (PLAN item 4): studio sidebar auto-generated from `meta.json` uniform declarations — range sliders for floats (min/max/step), color pickers for colors, live write-through into the running material's uniforms, per-entry reset. Values are re-applied when the material is recreated, so tweaks survive shader HMR. Material ownership moved from `Harness` to the studio page so panel and canvas share it. ([D5], [D6])
- Render harness + studio route (PLAN item 3): `src/lib/harness/` renders entries via `RawShaderMaterial` with the standard uniform contract (`u_time`, `u_resolution`, `u_mouse` from pointer tracking). Quad mode draws a fullscreen quad (default vertex shader supplies `vUv`); mesh mode adds PerspectiveCamera + OrbitControls + a 5-primitive geometry switcher; custom scenes (`Scene.svelte`, lazy-loaded, material passed as prop) render arbitrary Threlte geometry — demonstrated by fireball's core-plus-orbiting-embers scene. Studio view at `/shader/[slug]` (404 on unknown slugs); catalog validates `meta.json` `"scene"` against `Scene.svelte` presence. ([D3], [D4], [D8])

### Removed
- Scaffold smoke test (`src/lib/scaffold-smoke/`) — superseded by the render harness; the front page now links entries to their studio views.

### Added
- Shader loading (PLAN item 2): glob-built catalog (`src/lib/shaders/catalog.ts`) discovers `shaders/*/` folders, validates `meta.json` (harness mode, `u_`-prefixed uniform defs), and exposes typed entries; the front page lists discovered entries. Seeded with two entries: `plasma` (quad) and `fireball` (mesh, custom vertex shader + UE porting notes). Seed shaders load but don't render yet — that's the render harness, next in PLAN. ([D5])

### Fixed
- Custom scenes failed to lazy-load in dev (403/404 — `shaders/` is outside Vite's default file-serving allow list); `server.fs.allow` now includes it. Production builds were unaffected.

### Changed
- Gallery design direction: Preview Atlas composition with a featured live preview, supporting mosaic, persistent discovery rail, search-first command band, and compact selected-shader detail strip. ([D12])
- Electric Workbench palette: mulberry surface scale with restrained Deep Berry, Signal Red, and Hot Coral roles; active control chrome no longer uses bright accent fills broadly. ([D11])
- Package manager: npm → pnpm (pinned via `packageManager`; `pnpm-lock.yaml` replaces `package-lock.json`).

### Added
- App scaffold (PLAN item 1): SvelteKit + Vite + TypeScript (Svelte 5 runes mode), Three.js via Threlte, `vite-plugin-glsl` for `.glsl` imports with HMR. Includes a smoke-test scene (`src/lib/scaffold-smoke/` — raw GLSL on a torus knot via `RawShaderMaterial`); verified with `svelte-check`, a production build, and an SSR page fetch. ([D2], [D3], [D8])
- Project inception: shader-studio, a local-first look-dev sandbox for WebGL shaders destined for games (Unreal Engine 5/6) and website effects. No code yet — design + doc architecture only.

### Docs
- Product and visual design context: `PRODUCT.md`, the Electric Workbench token/component system in `DESIGN.md`, its Impeccable live-panel sidecar, and preconfigured SvelteKit live mode. ([D10])
- Living-documentation bootstrap: AGENTS.md (conventions + sources-of-truth map), design log with decisions [D1]–[D8], ADR-0001 (Three.js as plumbing, raw GLSL shaders), ADR-0002 (Threlte scene composition), design synthesis, glossary, PLAN, backlog, tech-debt, this changelog.
